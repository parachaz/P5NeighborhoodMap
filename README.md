This project is developed using Javascript MVC model.
index.html contains the "View" part of the project. It displays a dynamically generated list of Times Square places,
and a map of Times Square area. 
A JSON file provides the data for the map.
script.js contains the JavaScript functions to call Google Map API to build the map and add markers to the map.
index.html also contains search box, that can be used to filter (search for) a specific location from the given list.
