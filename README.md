# P5NeighborhoodMap
Udacity FrontEnd Web Developer NanaoDegree P5
This project is developed using Javascript MVVC model.
For this project I used Knockout.js.
index.html contains the "View" part of the project. It displays a dynamically generated list of Times Square places,
and a map of Times Square area. 
A JSON file provides the data for the map.
script.js contains the JavaScript functions to call Google Map API to build the map and add markers to the map. It used Knockout.js to dynamically add attraction list and the map on the view. 
index.html also contains search box, that can be used to filter (search for) a specific location from the given list. Search is implemented using RegEx and is triggered by Knockout binding.
